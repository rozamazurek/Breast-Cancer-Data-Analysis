# Breast Cancer Data Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing breast cancer data through various statistical visualizations. By using different types of plots, I explore key patterns and distributions in the dataset to gain insights into breast cancer characteristics.

## Features

- Data Processing – Cleaning and preprocessing breast cancer dataset.

- Statistical Analysis – Computing basic statistical summaries.

- Visualization – Generating various types of plots to explore data trends.

- Saving outcomes of the analysis into one file
